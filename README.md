# WpLibraryProject
## Placeholder for WpLibrary 
An OOP way to create wordpress themes.
Much to come, first I have to make myself more familiar in working with this platform!
## At present
For now I will keep the data in my 'dev' branch, reason for that is when I pass it to my 'master' branch I want to make sure all is up to date and working as intended "sure no guarantee it does"!
